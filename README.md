# rtl_fm_streamer_openwrt
My attempt at porting rtl_fm_streamer to the OpenWRT platform - WIP!

I had plans to use an old OpenWRT router to stream FM radio wireless to kodi devices in my home.

So far its just producing static, probally a cpu bottleneck but I need to look over it again in the future
